## 核心观点 (Core Viewpoints)
*   **不战而屈人之兵**: 百战百胜，非善之善者也；不战而屈人之兵，善之善者也。最高明的战略是无需战斗就达成目的。
*   **知彼知己**: 知彼知己，百战不殆。了解敌人和了解自己同样重要。
*   **先胜后战**: 胜兵先胜而后求战，败兵先战而后求胜。胜利是在战斗之前就计划好的。
*   **兵者诡道**: 兵者，诡道也。战争是欺骗的艺术。攻其无备，出其不意。

## 关键概念 (Key Concepts)
*   **道天地将法**: 战略五事：道（政治/民心）、天（天时）、地（地利）、将（将领）、法（法制）。
*   **虚实**: 避实而击虚。Attack where the enemy is weak, avoid where he is strong.
*   **势**: 利用形势的力量，如转圆石于千仞之山者，势也。
