## 核心观点 (Core Viewpoints)
*   **金融中介的利益冲突**: 华尔街的经纪人和银行家通过交易佣金和管理费致富，而不是通过帮助客户赚钱。
*   **预测的荒谬**: 大多数金融专家的预测并不比普通人准，但他们以此收费。
*   **讽刺与幽默**: 本书以幽默讽刺的笔触揭露了华尔街的荒诞现实：客户亏钱，经纪人发财。

## 关键概念 (Key Concepts)
*   **经纪人 (Broker)**: Ideally strictly an agent... but in practice, often incentivized to generate commissions. (理论上是代理人，但实际上往往为了赚取佣金而鼓励交易。)
*   **卖方 (The Sell Side)**: Firms that facilitate trading, issue research, and market securities. (促进交易、发布研报和推销证券的公司，他们的目标是销售产品。)
