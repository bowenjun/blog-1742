## 核心观点 (Core Viewpoints)
*   **分工**: 分工是劳动生产力提高的最大原因。它通过提高熟练程度、节省转换时间、促进机械发明来实现。
*   **看不见的手**: 个人追求私利的过程中，受一只看不见的手引导，反而比他有意促进社会利益时更有效地促进了社会利益。
*   **自由贸易**: 如果外国能以比我们更便宜的价格供应某种商品，我们最好就买他们的，而把我们的产业用于我们更有优势的领域。
*   **政府的职责**: 国防、司法、公共工程（由于利润太低私人不愿做）。

## 关键概念 (Key Concepts)
*   **看不见的手 (Invisible Hand)**: Metaphor for how self-interested individuals operate through a system of mutual interdependence. (隐喻自利个体如何在相互依赖的系统中运作。)
*   **分工 (Division of Labor)**: Breaking down production into specialized tasks to increase productivity. (将生产分解为专业化任务以提高生产力。)
*   **重商主义 (Mercantilism)**: Economic nationalism for the purpose of building a wealthy and powerful state, which Smith criticized. (旨在建立富强国家的经济民族主义，斯密对此进行了批判。)
